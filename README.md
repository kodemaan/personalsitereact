# personalsitereact
Simple personal website built in React

Installation:
In order to use this you will need NPM, NodeJS, and Gulp.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Gulp](https://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp)

Once that is done run the following commands in the root directory of this project:
* npm install
* gulp

That will start a web server on http://127.0.0.1:8000, and watch for changes on the JS files in the process directory.
